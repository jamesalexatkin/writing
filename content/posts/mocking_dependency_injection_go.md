This is a pattern I've used quite a bit at work and is pretty useful for unit testing.

# A scenario

Let's suppose we have a service `Service` which provides various bits of functionality.
One such function is registering users.
This interfaces with Amazon's [Cognito](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html) service for identity management, as well as doing other things, like maybe saving them to a database:

```go
type Service struct{
	CognitoClient *cognitoidentityprovider.Client
	// ...Other fields
}

func New() *Service {
	return &Service{
		CognitoClient: cognitoidentityprovider.New(),
	}
}

func (s *Service) RegisterUser(ctx context.Context, params RegisterParams) error {
	slog.Info("registering user")

	// Confirm user on Cognito
	_, err := s.CognitoClient.ConfirmSignUp(
		ctx,
		"eu-west-2",
		&cognitoidentityprovider.ConfirmSignUpInput{
		    ClientId:         &params.ClientID,
		    ConfirmationCode: &params.Code,
		    Username:         &params.Username,
		},
	)
	if err != nil {
		slog.Error("failed to confirm user sign-up")
		return err
	}

	// ...Do other stuff with database here

	return nil
}
```

Let's write a simple test for this now.

```go
package service_test

func Test_RegisterUserSuccess(t *testing.T) {
	s := service.New()

	testParams := RegisterParams{
		// ...Fill with correct values
	}

	err := s.RegisterUser(context.Background(), testParams)
	require.NoError(t, err)
}
```

# The problem

What happens now?
The test will attempt to reach a real version of AWS Cognito. This is undesirable for a couple of reasons.

Firstly, it relies on an actual instance of Cognito being live and hosted. Behemoth that it is, AWS is so widely used that we can consider it reliable, but a smaller service may not be. Network connections, latency and service uptime can all make tests non-hermetic, not to mention AWS' notorious pricing structure being an unnecessary overhead.

{{< figure src="https://jamesatk.in/blog/images/chatgpt_aws_joke.png" align=center caption="*(I think ChatGPT's humour needs some work but it gets the point across.)*" >}}

Secondly, it violates the principle of unit tests since the bounds of the test exceed the unit of code under test (the `RegisterUser` function).

# The solution?

**Dependency injection.**

At the time of writing, Wikipedia defines [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) as

> a programming technique in which an object or function receives other objects or functions that it requires, as opposed to creating them internally

Using this principle we can _inject_ the _dependency_ of the Cognito client into the service of the constructor:

```go
func New(cognitoClient *cognitoidentityprovider.Client) *Service {
	return &Service{
		CognitoClient: cognitoClient,
	}
}
```

Now we can configure our client however we like and pass it through. This allows for differently configured clients in the real code and the test, however we still have the problem that it's hitting the _genuine_ Cognito service.

Rather than using a concrete Cognito client (which is rigidly inflexible for our purposes), we can inject something that _looks like a Cognito client_ instead. We can accomplish this by writing an interface to mimic the desired functionality. This provides a contract that can accommodate any passed dependency - provided it fulfils the interface.

```go
type IdentityProvider interface {
    ConfirmSignUp(ctx context.Context, params *cognitoidentityprovider.ConfirmSignUpInput, optFns ...func(*cognitoidentityprovider.Options)) (*cognitoidentityprovider.ConfirmSignUpOutput, error)
}
```

And then updating the `Service` and constructor:

```go
type Service struct{
	CognitoClient IdentityProvider
	// ...Other fields
}

func New(cognitoClient IdentityProvider) *Service {
	return &Service{
		CognitoClient: cognitoClient,
	}
}
```

We can then revisit the tests, setting up our mocks for Cognito. Since these also fulfil the `IdentityProvider` contract, they can be passed to `Service.New()`.

(You can substitute whatever mocks you like here, I like the [`gomock` ](https://github.com/uber-go/mock) library as it generates them all for you.)

```go
package service_test

func Test_RegisterUserSuccess(t *testing.T) {
	testParams := RegisterParams{
		// ...Fill with correct values
	}

	// Start gomock Controller
	ctrl := gomock.NewController(t)
	defer ctrl.Finish()

	// Initialise mock
	mockIdentityProvider := mocks.NewMockIdentityProvider(ctrl)
	mockIdentityProvider.EXPECT().ConfirmSignUp(gomock.Any(), "eu-west-2", &cognitoidentityprovider.ConfirmSignUpInput{
	    ClientId:         &testParams.ClientID,
	    ConfirmationCode: &testParams.Code,
	    Username:         &testParams.Username,
	}).Return(nil, nil)

	// Pass the mock
	s := service.New(mockIdentityProvider)

	err := s.RegisterUser(context.Background(), testParams)
	require.NoError(t, err)
}
```

A handy side-effect of using the `IdentityProvider` interface is that it opens the door for us to add functionality around the Cognito calls in future if we wished. We could write our own [shim](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)>) struct around this to provide extra logging or metric exporting, for instance.
